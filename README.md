Hi, I'm Ayesha! (Upcoming programmer and Engineering Student) 

I am an Engineering student with a passion for programming, coding, puzzles and design. I currently attend the University of Guelph majoring in Engineering Systems and Computing. My major encompases the principles of computer and electrical engineering and integrating it into mechanical principles. 

I choose to pursue Engineering post-secondary because of its endless application in every industry imaginable. My first encounter with the concept of engineering was on a TVO kids show called 'Science Max; Experiments at Large'. The scientist in this show would craft experiements to demostrate a scientific concept. He would then optimize the experiment so it would run more effieciently. The idea that things can always be improved stuck with me through the years, eventually leading me to computer and mechatronical engineering.
